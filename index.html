  <h1> WEB </h1>
  <p>A web page (also written as webpage) is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and web browsers.
    A web browser displays a web page on a monitor or mobile device. 
    The web page usually means what is visible, but the term may also refer to a computer file, usually written in HTML or a comparable markup language. Web browsers coordinate various web resource elements for the written web page, such as style sheets, scripts, and images, to present the web page. Typical web pages provide hypertext that includes a navigation bar or a sidebar menu linking to other web pages via hyperlinks, often referred to as links.
    On a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote web server.
    The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet.
    The web browser uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to make such requests.
    A static web page is delivered exactly as stored, as web content in the web server's file system.
    In contrast, a dynamic web page is generated by a web application, usually driven by server-side software.
    Dynamic web pages help the browser (the client) to enhance the web page through user input to the server.
